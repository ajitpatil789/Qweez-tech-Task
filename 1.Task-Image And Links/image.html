        <h2>Interesting Facts About Tigers</h2>
        
            <br>Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world, weighing up to 700 pounds.</br>
                They have unique stripes, much like human fingerprints, that make each tiger identifiable.
                Unlike most cats, tigers are great swimmers and often cool off in waterholes during the heat of the day.
                They are apex predators and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of ecosystems.
                Tigers are unfortunately endangered, with only around 3,900 left in the wild.</p>
